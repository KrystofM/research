## Running the code
1. Clone this repository (or download the zip file)
2. In `isomorphismproject` create a directory called `input`, or if you wish to call it something else, then change the `folder` parameter in the main function of `main.py`.
   Don't forget to put a / after the folder name.
3. Place your `.gr` and `.grl` files into the directory you are testing
4. Run the script:
   ```bash 
   python main.py
   ```
5. If the filename has the `.gr` extension, automorphisms will be counted
6. If the filename has the `.grl` extension, and contains `GI`, but not `Aut`, only isomorphisms will be identified
6. If the filename has the `.grl` extension, and contains `Aut` and `GI`, both isomorphisms and automorphisms will be identified
7. If the filename has the `.grl` extension, and contains `Aut`, but not `GI`, then only automorphisms will be counted for each graph
